# JS Strip Follow Along Dropdown

## Description

The aim of this exercise is to create a navigation menu, where whenever we hover over it, the background of each dropdown will transform itself (in width, height and position).

To achieve this effect, while the content of each dropdown is a separate element, the white background is a unique div that follows around each content (changing its dimensions and absolute position). 

## Javascript Used

* querySelectorAll()
* classList (add, remove, contains)
* setTimeOut()
* Element.getBoundingClientRect()
* HTMLElement.style
* event listeners (mouseenter and mouseleave)
* forEach()


## Element.getBoundingClientRect()

Using the `Element.getBoundingClientRect()` method, we are able to obtain information about the size of an element and its position relative to the viewport.
